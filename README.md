### Aim:
Write a Python program for the modulation and demodulation of ASK.
### Tools required:
Python IDE with Numpy and Scipy
### Program
```
Attach the program
```
### Output Waveform
```
Attach the output waveform
```
### Results
The experiment on ASK modulation and demodulation was successfully implemented in Python. The demodulated data matches the original binary input, validating the working of the ASK technique.
