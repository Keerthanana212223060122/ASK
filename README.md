# Exp:5 ASK
# Name: Keerthana S
# Reg No: 212223060122
### Aim:
Write a Python program for the modulation and demodulation of ASK.
### Tools required:

Python IDE with Numpy and Scipy

### Program:
```
Attach the program
```
### Output Waveform:
```
Attach the output waveform
```
### Results:

The experiment on ASK modulation and demodulation was successfully implemented in Python. The demodulated data matches the original binary input, validating the working of the ASK technique.
